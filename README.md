# The Dendrite Project
Dendrite is a simple solution to achieve BlockChain and Supply Chain Integration for small scale companies! You can track and fine tune each step of the supply chain!
Dendrite aims to give you the ability to have transparency with your customers. Using a QR Code, the customers will be able to see Exactly all the processes involved in the 
respective projects' supply chain.

## TechStack
1. Python (Flask & BigChainAPI)
2. MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
3. BigChainDB (A Blockchain based Database Solution)
4. Tendermint
5. Google Cloud Platform

### This Project was built as a part of a 24 hour Hackathon named OakFest 2019 by Oakridge International School, Bangalore.


## Project Status
This project is currently on infinite hiatus and has been since 2019. It is a serious pain to work with mainly, Tendermint and BigChainDB have terrible developer experiences
hence, neither me nor my co-worker have any interest to do this anymore. It worked flawlessly in the Technical Demo during the Hackathon. However, since then we shut down
the GCP instances and there is no demo to show right now. We might make a version 2 of this someday as it is a fairly good PoC. Just need the time and the motivation to pick up
this titanic sized shipwreck of a project
