Known problems we wish to solve:
* Globalization : For some companies, outsourcing production involves not only a single country, but several countries for different parts of their products. Dendrite solves this by creating a safe network on to the internet where various parts of the supplychain can interact and stay on the same page.
* Quality : Passing quality control and safety tests, startups are also required to prepare compliance documents such as permits, licenses, and certification which can overwhelm them and their supply chain management systems. Dendrite solves this by the blockchain approach,it uses behind the scenes, to maintian genuinity and proper legal documents.
